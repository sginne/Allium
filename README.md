# Allium shop for deepweb

## Introduction
There were a lot of deepweb markets, starting with *Silkroad*.
Markets are centralized, which makes them easy to track and close.

I, however, think that free trade should co-exist with regulated trade, and to make free, unregulated trade possible, I've decided to make opensource shop.

Reason? So that everyone with very basic technical skill can safely run own, small outlet on the *darkweb*, mostly *Tor*,yet I think it will work under any layer of security, or even on *clearnet*

So, **Alliuâ‚·hop** was born, very lightweight *python3/flask* shop, made with deepweb in mind.

* No blockchain downloading, only bitcoin supported at the moment
* No graphics, except pictures of goods for sale
* Easy sweeping (Electrum supports sweeping, for example)
* Extremely easy installation, which requires very basic knowledge of linux 
* Opensource, no binaries of any kind - you control and own your own shop
