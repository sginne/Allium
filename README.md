# Allium shop for deepweb

## Introduction
There were a lot of deepweb markets, starting with Silkroad.
Markets are centralized, which makes them easy to track and close.

I, however, think that free trade should co-exist with regulated trade, and to make free, unregulated trade possible, I've decided to make opensource shop.

So, **Allium** was born, very lightweight *python3/flask* shop, made with deepweb in mind.

* No blockchain downloading, only bitcoin supported at the moment
* No graphics, except pictures of goods for sale
* Easy sweeping (Electrum supports sweeping, for example)
* Extremely easy installation, which requires very basic knowledge of linux 
* Opensource, no binaries of any kind - you control and own your own shop
